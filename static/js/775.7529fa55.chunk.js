What similarity tells us is that the ratios of the side lengths must be equivalent.

Therefore, when two angles are shown to be equal, the third must also be equal, creating these proportions. For example, in the previous model: <strong>a / b = e / d</strong>. Right triangles are the only triangles where you can have this and its two components similar, due to the creation of two equal degree angles when bisecting the hypotenuse.

Interestingly, the \u201cfirst part\u201d was proved secondly, and the \u201csecond part\u201d was proved first. However, it makes much more sense for any calculus student to learn the first part\'s proof, then the second one, despite the order that they were proven. Let\'s jump right into the first part!</p><p>The first part of the fundamental theorem of calculus connects the idea of a derivative and an integral. It states that the derivative of an integral returns the original function. In mathematical notation: \\\\[\\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\left[\\\\int f(x) \\\\, dx\\\\right] = f(x)\\\\]This can also be used to say that the integral of f(x) (area under the curve) is just the \u201cantiderivative\u201d of f(x), or in simpler terms, a function g(x) where its derivative of f(x). As we can see, proving this theorem will give us a gateway into actually solving integrals, one of the hardest tasks in calculus.</p><p>But why would we even consider a relationship in the first place? Well, let\'s consider a very general function, f(x).</p><img src=\'/imgs/Proofs/3_1.png\' alt=\'Graph showing the area under the curve f(x) from red vertical line a to blue vertical line x, creating bounds representing the area function, A(x).\'><p>Now, consider f(x) and A(x), where A(x) is the area function. Basically, we are assuming that the area under any curve can be considered some function of x. As we see with the blue line to the right, changing that also changes the overall area of the function. If f(x) is decreasing, then the added area to A(x) will become less and less large. Here, we can intuitively see a connection to the derivative of f(x) and A(x). It just so happens that the area function IS the antiderivative of f(x), which is less intuitive to see.</p><p>Lets begin with the proof:</p><p>Consider A(x) and f(x) where A(x) is the area function to f(x). We are to prove that A\'(x) = f(x).</p><p>Let\'s begin with the definition of a derivative, just to see if we can work with that somehow: \\\\[ A\'(x) = \\\\lim_{h \\\\to 0} \\\\left[ \\\\frac{A(x+h) - A(x)}{h} \\\\right] \\\\]</p><p>Notice A(x + h) and A(x). These appear to be the difference of 2 areas. Let\'s represent this graphically.</p><img src=\'/imgs/Proofs/3_2.png\' alt=\'Graph showing the area under the curve f(x), with bounds at x and x + h marking the area of A(x + h) - A(x).\'><p>As we see, A(x+h) - A(x) must be some definite area, but what? Here, we will use interesting logic in our proof. First thing, we notice that the value of f(x) at point x shown is at a minimum, and f(x+h) is at a maximum for the interval x to x+h. That seems unique, why isn\'t x+h moved a bit more to the right, where it wouldn\'t be a maximum of the interval? Well, the key is that the expression A(x+h) - A(x) is a limit, so \u201ch\u201d is meant to be a slight nudge to x. It seems a lot more like a nudge on the graph to show the idea of the area under a curve. Since \u201ch\u201d approaches 0, it is meant to be a \u201csufficiently small\u201d value. This means that either f(x) or f(x+h) is a max or a min, depending if the function is increasing or not, because the distance between x and x+h will approach 0. Although it doesn\'t really matter as we will see, the function is increasing so f(x+h) will be the max. and f(x) will be the min.</p><p>Now with that settled, why does that even matter? Well, we know the area between x and x+h is an area, and that f(x) is the lowest point on the graph, and f(x+h) is the highest. Now, we know that the area in the interval is some area value, A. Let\'s simplify the area for A greatly. Let\'s say that the area for A is just the area of some rectangle with the width of the interval h. Then, A = h*f(c), where f(c) is some height between f(x) and f(x+h). Ok\u2026 but how does that help us? Well, we know that f(x) is a minimum, so f(x) * h MUST be smaller than the actual area for the interval, because all other points on the graph are greater than f(x). So, if you view the interval as the sum of a bunch of rectangles, we just took the smallest rectangle and spread it across the interval, meaning it must be smaller. With similar logic, since f(x+h) is a maximum, it MUST be larger than the actual area. With that, we know that f(c) must be somewhere between f(x) and f(x+h). Since our function is continuous, we know that every value must exist between f(x) and f(x+h), which means every value must exist between f(x)*h and f(x+h)*h. This means that area A must exist in the form f(c) * h, where c \u2208 [x, x+h]. \\\\[ A\'(x) = \\\\lim_{h \\\\to 0} \\\\left[ \\\\frac{A(x+h) - A(x)}{h} \\\\right] \\\\]</p><p>Back to the actual math, we essentially just logically proven that A(x+h) - A(x) = f(c) * h. Let\'s substitute that in! \\\\[ A\'(x) = \\\\lim_{h \\\\to 0} \\\\left[ \\\\frac{f(c) * h}{h} \\\\right] \\\\] \\\\[ A\'(x) = \\\\lim_{h \\\\to 0} \\\\left[ f(c) \\\\right] \\\\]</p><p>Now, we know that c \u2208 [x, x + h] then, \\\\[ x \\\\leq c \\\\leq x + h \\\\]</p><p>But, h\u21920, so: \\\\[ x \\\\leq c \\\\leq x \\\\]</p><p>Which means c = x, meaning f(c) = f(x), solving the limit.</p><p>A\'(x) = f(x), which is what we meant to prove.</p>"}]}}')}}]);
