Quadratic equations have been known to mathematicians since ancient times, however it is believed that a formula to solve all quadratic equations was discovered much later by Arab mathematicians in 9th Century A.D. But what exactly is a quadratic equation?</p><p>To be considered quadratic, the highest degree term in a polynomial must be <strong>x<sup>2</sup></strong>. Some examples of this are: <strong>x<sup>2</sup></strong>, <strong>9x<sup>2</sup> + 6x + 7</strong>, <strong>y = 3x<sup>2</sup> - 9</strong>, etc. Each of these are considered quadratic expressions / equations. But, how do we solve them?</p><p>First, there is solving linear equations: which is something we may be more familiar with. Linear equations are always in the form: <strong>y = mx + b</strong>. Solving these usually consists of using simple operations to isolate the variable <strong>x</strong>.  Let\'s walk through an example.</p><p><strong>9x + 15 = 6</strong><br><strong>9x = -11</strong> (subtract 15 from both sides)<br><strong>x = -11/9</strong> (divide 9 from both sides)</p><p>Quite simple! Moving on, it is standard for linear and quadratic equations like these to first be made equal to 0 for simplicity.</p><p><strong>ax + b = 0 {a \u2260 0}</strong> (if <strong>a</strong> was 0, there would be no <strong>x</strong> in the equation!)</p><p>How do we solve this? There are no numbers for coefficients! Before we panic, we\'ll simply use the same process we did before to solve this general case.</p><p><strong>ax + b = 0</strong><br><strong>ax = -b</strong> (subtract <strong>b</strong> from both sides)<br><strong>x = -b/a</strong> (divide by <strong>a</strong> on both sides)</p><p>We have just created an equation that can be used to solve any linear equation when equal to 0! Try it yourself with the first example, just make sure the equation equals 0.</p><p>While this is great and all, we are still trying to discover how to solve quadratic equations, not linear ones. When looking at quadratics, we can see that they either come in 1, 2 or 3 terms.</p><p>1 term: <strong>x<sup>2</sup> = 0</strong><br>2 terms: <strong>x<sup>2</sup> + 9 = 0</strong>, <strong>3x<sup>2</sup> + 5x = 0</strong>, etc.<br>3 terms: <strong>3x<sup>2</sup> + 5x + 7 = 0</strong>, <strong>11x<sup>2</sup> + 6x + 9 = 15</strong> (remember, you can subtract 15 from both sides), etc.</p><p>Let\'s attempt to solve all three kinds of these quadratics. One term quadratics are the easiest because they always are 0!</p><p><strong>11x<sup>2</sup> = 0</strong><br><strong>x<sup>2</sup> = 0</strong> (divide by 11 on both sides)<br><strong>x = 0</strong> (square root both sides)</p><p>Something slightly more challenging would be the two term quadratics, however they are very similar to the first.</p><p><strong>5x<sup>2</sup> + 7 = 11</strong><br><strong>5x<sup>2</sup> = 4</strong> (subtract 7 from both sides)<br><strong>x<sup>2</sup> = 4/5</strong> (divide by 5 on both sides)<br><strong>x = +2/\u221a5, -2/\u221a5</strong> (take the square root on both sides, remember this gives us a positive and negative answer)</p><p><strong>5x<sup>2</sup> + 7x = 0</strong><br><strong>x(5x + 7) = 0</strong> (factor out an <strong>x</strong> from the left)</p><p>Here we can use the 0 product law, where we know that anything times 0 is 0! So, if we have two separate terms, <strong>x</strong> and <strong>(5x+7)</strong> multiplying to equal 0, we know that two cases can arise, where the first term <strong>x</strong> is 0 OR the second term <strong>(5x+7)</strong> is 0. This can give us two solutions by breaking up the equation.</p><strong>x = 0<br>AND<br>5x + 7 = 0<br>x = -7/5<br>Therefore, x = {-7/5, 0}</strong><p>For many, all of this is simply review, however understanding these simpler cases is integral to understanding the most general case: the three term quadratic. ALL quadratics can be expressed like this: <strong>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0 {a \u2260 0}</strong>. To get the one and two term quadratics, <strong>b</strong> and <strong>c</strong> can both be 0. So how do we solve the generic 3 term?</p><strong>2x<sup>2</sup> + 11x - 2 = 0</strong><p>We can try to move things around and factor things out, but nothing seems to help us. Try things out for yourself! You\'ll see that you won\'t be able to isolate <strong>x</strong> without a different method of factoring.</p><p>To solve this equation, we need to condense it where we have two terms to easily solve, but how do we do that? Let\'s look at the expression <strong>(x + y)<sup>2</sup></strong> and multiply it out. <strong>(x + y)(x + y)</strong> using FOIL, gives us <strong>x<sup>2</sup> + 2yx + y<sup>2</sup></strong>. An expression like <strong>(x + 2)<sup>2</sup></strong> becomes <strong>x<sup>2</sup> + 4x + 4</strong>, a three term quadratic that can be factored and condensed! So, if we get any quadratic into <strong>x<sup>2</sup> + 2yx + y<sup>2</sup></strong> form, we might be able to solve quadratics in all cases.</p><strong>2x<sup>2</sup> + 11x - 2 = 0</strong><p>Let\'s rearrange this into something that could be put in <strong>x<sup>2</sup> + 2yx + y<sup>2</sup></strong> form.</p><p><strong>x<sup>2</sup> + (11/2)x = 1</strong> (added 2 on both sides, then divided everything by 2).</p><p>Looking at the coefficient <strong>(11/4)</strong>, it can be expressed in <strong>2y</strong> form: <strong>2 * (11/4)</strong> where <strong>y = 11/4</strong>.</p><strong>x<sup>2</sup> + (2)(11/4)x = 1</strong><p>We are getting close to the form we want, we just need to take <strong>y<sup>2</sup></strong> and add it to this equation. We know <strong>y = 11/4</strong>, so we should square this and add it to both sides!</p><strong><sup>2</sup> + (2)(11/4)x + (11/4)<sup>2</sup> = 1 + (11/4)<sup>2</sup></strong><p>Now, we can factor the left side. Since it\'s in <strong>x<sup>2</sup> + 2yx + y<sup>2</sup></strong> form, let\'s turn it into <strong>(x + y)<sup>2</sup></strong>.</p><strong>(x + 11/4)<sup>2</sup> = 1 + (11/4)<sup>2</sup><br>x + 11/4 = +/- \u221a[1 + (11/4)<sup>2</sup>]<br>x = -11/4 +/- \u221a[1 + (11/4)<sup>2</sup>]</strong><p>And those are our answers. If we look at the process, we brought the constant term to the other side, divided by the <strong>x<sup>2</sup></strong> coefficient, and then added a specific constant term to both sides of the equation that allowed us to factor. Considering <strong>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</strong>, it was half of <strong>b</strong> and then squared: <strong>(b/2)<sup>2</sup></strong> or <strong>b<sup>2</sup>/4</strong>. Adding that then allows us to factor to <strong>(x + b/2)<sup>2</sup></strong>.</p><p>This process is called &#34;completing the square&#34; and can be used in all cases. Here is a visualization of the process &#34;completing&#34; the square in a sense.</p><img src=\'/imgs/Algebra/1_1.webp\' alt=\'A large square with an area of (x + b/2) squared. Comprising the area of the square, there is a smaller square, two rectangles, and a tiny square. The smaller square has an area of x squared. One of the two identical rectangles has dimensions of (b/2) times x. The tiny square has an area of (b/2) squared.\'><p>The large square and the two rectangular areas represent <strong>x<sup>2</sup> + bx</strong> when all added together. With only that, the square isn\'t finished. However, adding the small square area of <strong>(b/2)<sup>2</sup></strong> completes it into the entire square of the area <strong>(x + b/2)<sup>2</sup></strong>. An example of completeing the square:</p><p><strong>3x<sup>2</sup> + 6x - 8 = 0</strong> (Step 1: Get <strong>x<sup>2</sup> + bx</strong> alone.)<br><strong>3x<sup>2</sup> + 6x = 8</strong><br><strong>x2 + 2x = 8/3</strong> (Step 2: Add <strong>b<sup>2</sup>/4</strong> to both sides.)<br><strong>x<sup>2</sup> + 2x + 1 = 11/3</strong> (Step 3: Factor to <strong>(x + b/2)<sup>2</sup></strong> and solve.)<br><strong>(x + 1)<sup>2</sup> = 11/3</strong><br><strong>x + 1 = +/- \u221a(11/3)</strong><br><strong>x = -1 +/- \u221a(11/3)</strong></p><p>Perhaps there is a formula to solve all quadratics like linear equations.

At its core, there are the most important parts: <strong>\xb1</strong> and <strong>b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac</strong>. The <strong>\xb1</strong> gives us the ability for 2 possible solutions, however what lies in the radical: <strong>b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac</strong>, determines the nature of these roots. This is why we refer to it as the &#34;discriminant&#34;. When <strong>b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac = 0</strong>, there is always 1 solution to the quadratic, as you either add or subtract <strong>0</strong> in the equation. This is considered the &#34;double root&#34;, and is graphically represented with a parabola that touches the x axis only once. When <strong>b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac > 0</strong>, there are always 2 solutions, and when <strong>b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac < 0</strong>, there are 2 complex solutions intuitively. These complex solutions always come in conjugates, as the complex component is either added or subtracted from the real component <strong>-b</strong>.
