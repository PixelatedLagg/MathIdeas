Interestingly, the 'first part' was proved secondly, and the 'second part' was proved first. However, it makes much more sense for any calculus student to learn the first part's proof, then the second one, despite the order that they were proven. So let's jump right into the first part!</p><p>The first part of the fundamental theorem of calculus connects the idea of a <strong>derivative</strong> and an <strong>integral</strong>. It states that the <strong>derivative</strong> of an <strong>integral</strong> returns the original function. In mathematical notation: \\\\[\\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\left[\\\\int f(x) \\\\, dx\\\\right] = f(x)\\\\]This can also be used to say that the <strong>integral</strong> of <strong>f(x)</strong> (area under the curve) is just the <strong>antiderivative</strong> of <strong>f(x)</strong>, or in simpler terms, a function <strong>g(x)</strong> where it's derivative of <strong>f(x)</strong>. As we can see, proving this theorem will give us a gateway into actually solving <strong>integrals</strong>, one of the hardest tasks in calculus.</p><p>But why would we even consider a relationship in the first place? Well, let's consider a very general function, <strong>f(x)</strong>.</p><img src='/imgs/Proofs/3_1.png' alt='Graph showing the area under the curve f(x) from red vertical line a to blue vertical line x, creating bounds representing the area function, A(x).'><p>Observe <strong>f(x)</strong> and <strong>A(x)</strong>, where <strong>A(x)</strong> is the area function. Basically, we are assuming that the area under any curve can be considered some function of <strong>x</strong>. As we see with the blue line to the right, changing that also changes the overall area of the function. If <strong>f(x)</strong> is decreasing, then the added area to <strong>A(x)</strong> will become less and less large. Here, we can intuitively see a connection to the <strong>derivative</strong> of <strong>f(x)</strong> and <strong>A(x)</strong>. It just so happens that the area function IS the <strong>antiderivative</strong> of <strong>f(x)</strong>, which is less intuitive to see.</p><p>Lets begin with the proof:</p><p>Consider <strong>A(x)</strong> and <strong>f(x)</strong> where <strong>A(x)</strong> is the area function to <strong>f(x)</strong>. We are to prove that <strong>A'(x) = f(x)</strong>.</p><p>Let's begin with the definition of a <strong>derivative</strong>, just to see if we can work with that somehow: \\\\[ A'(x) = \\\\lim_{h \\\\to 0} \\\\left[ \\\\frac{A(x+h) - A(x)}{h} \\\\right] \\\\]</p><p>Notice <strong>A(x + h)</strong> and <strong>A(x)</strong>. These appear to be the difference of two areas. Let's represent this graphically.</p><img src='/imgs/Proofs/3_2.png' alt='Graph showing the area under the curve f(x), with bounds at x and x + h marking the area of A(x + h) - A(x).'><p>As we see, <strong>A(x + h) - A(x)</strong> must be some definite area, but what? Here, we will use interesting logic in our proof. The first thing we notice is that the value of <strong>f(x)</strong> at point <strong>x</strong> shown is at a minimum, and <strong>f(x+h)</strong> is at a maximum for the interval <strong>x</strong> to <strong>x + h</strong>. That seems unique, why isn't <strong>x + h</strong> moved a bit more to the right, where it wouldn't be a maximum of the interval? Well, the key is that the expression <strong>A(x + h) - A(x)</strong> is a limit, so <strong>h</strong> is meant to be a slight nudge to <strong>x</strong>. It seems a lot more like a nudge on the graph to show the idea of the area under a curve. Since <strong>h</strong> approaches <strong>0</strong>, it is meant to be a \u201csufficiently small\u201d value. This means that either <strong>f(x)</strong> or <strong>f(x + h)</strong> is a max or a min, depending if the function is increasing or not, because the distance between <strong>x</strong> and <strong>x + h</strong> will approach <strong>0</strong>. Although it doesn't really matter as we will see, the function is increasing so <strong>f(x + h)</strong> will be the max. and <strong>f(x)</strong> will be the min.</p><p>Now with that settled, why does that even matter? Well, we know the area between <strong>x</strong> and <strong>x + h</strong> is an area, and that <strong>f(x)</strong> is the lowest point on the graph, and <strong>f(x + h)</strong> is the highest. Now, we know that the area in the interval is some area value, <strong>A</strong>. Let's simplify the area for <strong>A</strong> greatly. Let's say that the area for <strong>A</strong> is just the area of some rectangle with the width of the interval <strong>h</strong>. Then, <strong>A = h * f(c)</strong>, where <strong>f(c)</strong> is some height between <strong>f(x)</strong> and <strong>f(x + h)</strong>. Ok\u2026 but how does that help us? Well, we know that <strong>f(x)</strong> is a minimum, so <strong>f(x) * h</strong> MUST be smaller than the actual area for the interval, because all other points on the graph are greater than <strong>f(x)</strong>. So, if you view the interval as the sum of a bunch of rectangles, we just took the smallest rectangle and spread it across the interval, meaning it must be smaller. With similar logic, since <strong>f(x + h)</strong> is a maximum, it MUST be larger than the actual area. With that, we know that <strong>f(c)</strong> must be somewhere between <strong>f(x)</strong> and <strong>f(x + h)</strong>. Since our function is continuous, we know that every value must exist between <strong>f(x)</strong> and <strong>f(x + h)</strong>, which means every value must exist between <strong>f(x) * h</strong> and <strong>f(x + h) * h</strong>. This means that area <strong>A</strong> must exist in the form <strong>f(c) * h</strong>, where <strong>c \u2208 [x, x + h]</strong>. \\\\[ A'(x) = \\\\lim_{h \\\\to 0} \\\\left[ \\\\frac{A(x+h) - A(x)}{h} \\\\right] \\\\]</p><p>Back to the actual math, we've essentially just logically proven that <strong>A(x + h) - A(x) = f(c) * h</strong>. Let's substitute that in! \\\\[ A'(x) = \\\\lim_{h \\\\to 0} \\\\left[ \\\\frac{f(c) * h}{h} \\\\right] \\\\] \\\\[ A'(x) = \\\\lim_{h \\\\to 0} \\\\left[ f(c) \\\\right] \\\\]</p><p>Now, we know that <strong>c \u2208 [x, x + h]</strong> then, \\\\[ x \\\\leq c \\\\leq x + h \\\\]</p><p>But, <strong>h\u21920</strong>, so: \\\\[ x \\\\leq c \\\\leq x \\\\]</p><p>Which means <strong>c = x</strong>, meaning <strong>f(c) = f(x)</strong>, solving the limit.</p><p><strong>A'(x) = f(x)</strong>, which is what we intended to prove.</p>\"]},\"proof-of-the-fundamental-theorem-of-calculus-part-ii\":{\"title\":\"Proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Part II\",\"sections\":[\"<h1>Proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Part II</h1><i>Alexander De Carlo</i><p>There is a problem with the first part of our theorem. But\u2026 didn't we just prove it true? We did, but not to where we can do anything meaningful. What do we mean by this?</p><p>Note that we just proved <strong>A'(x) = f(x)</strong>, meaning the <strong>derivative</strong> of the area function of a graph is <strong>f(x)</strong>. But what precisely is the area function? Where does it begin, and where does it conclude? How can it be effectively expressed? The graph used in proving the first part of our fundamental theorem was convenient because it had a definite starting point. However, most graphs do not. Fortunately, we can choose the starting point of a graph without a clear beginning to be anywhere. But what implications does this have for our area function?</p><p>To answer this, let's consider the <strong>derivative</strong> of <strong>x<sup>2</sup></strong>:</p>\\\\[ \\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\left[ x^2 \\\\right] = 2x \\\\]<p>Cool! What about <strong>x<sup>2</sup> + 1</strong>?</p>\\\\[ \\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\left[ x^2 + 1 \\\\right] = 2x \\\\]<p><strong>x<sup>2</sup> + C</strong>?</p>\\\\[ \\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\left[ x^2 + C \\\\right] = 2x \\\\]<p>As we see, many things can share a <strong>derivative</strong>. Since the <strong>derivative</strong> of a constant is always <strong>0</strong>, the <strong>antiderivative</strong> of a function always has \\\"<strong>+ C</strong>\\\" after it, indicating that the <strong>antiderivative</strong> of a function is actually a family of functions that all differ from a constant value.</p><p>So, if <strong>A(x)</strong> is just the <strong>antiderivative</strong> of <strong>f(x)</strong>, which we had just proven, then <strong>A(x) = F(x) + C</strong>. <strong>F(x)</strong> is just denoting the <strong>antiderivative</strong> function for <strong>A(x)</strong>. It actually makes sense why a <strong>C</strong> needs to be there for such a general area function.</p><img src='/imgs/Proofs/4_1.png' alt='The graph shows a function f(x) and two points E and D on the x-axis with the corresponding vertical lines to the curve. The difference between the two x-coordinates is called h.'><p>Whether we start our area function at <strong>D</strong> or <strong>E</strong>, all the areas to the left of both <strong>D</strong> and <strong>E</strong> are the same. This means the area functions for both SHOULD be the same, just differing by some constant, <strong>C</strong>. This is called the <strong>indefinite integral</strong>.</p>\\\\[ \\\\int f(x) \\\\, dx = F(x) + C \\\\]<p>The explanation for the notation will be shown in a different article. Here, we are essentially finding an area function for <strong>f(x)</strong>, but we have no bounds on that function. The changing of bounds will just differ by a constant <strong>C</strong>, shown above.</p><p>We want to know how to evaluate <strong>integrals</strong> WITH bounds, however. The good thing is, we already know it should really include the area function. Let's say we start our <strong>integral</strong> at defined point <strong>a</strong>, and it goes to some variable point <strong>x</strong>.</p>\\\\[ A(x) = \\\\int_{a}^{x} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\]<p>The variable <strong>t</strong> here is a dummy variable, because we are trying to show that <strong>x</strong> could be any point on the graph <strong>f(t)</strong>, which originally would be called <strong>f(x)</strong>. The <strong>\\\"x\\\"-axis</strong> would be called the <strong>\\\"t\\\"-axis</strong> to make things clearer. Essentially it's just changing the name of variables so as to not get the <strong>x</strong> in <strong>f(x)</strong> confused with the <strong>x</strong> on the <strong>integral</strong>.</p><p>We know that <strong>A(x)</strong> is the <strong>antiderivative</strong> of <strong>f(x)</strong>, so <strong>A(x) = F(x) + C</strong>. Thus:</p>\\\\[ F(x) + C = \\\\int_{a}^{x} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\]<p>The important thing to note here is that we defined one boundary for the <strong>integral</strong>, at <strong>A</strong>. this means that we should be able to somehow solve for <strong>C</strong>, as <strong>C</strong> can no longer be just any constant. This <strong>integral</strong> with one bound at <strong>A</strong> should no longer be a family of <strong>antiderivatives</strong>, but just one specific <strong>antiderivative</strong>. But how can we solve it?  Well, we can do a sneaky trick. Let's make <strong>x</strong> some defined point <strong>B</strong>, essentially finding the area of some interval.</p><p>Then:</p>\\\\[ C = \\\\int_{a}^{b} f(t) \\\\, dt - F(b) \\\\]<p>That didn't really help us. But since we start at <strong>A</strong>, <strong>C</strong> must be the same, for any other arbitrary endpoint we pick. Then, how can we get rid of the nasty <strong>integral</strong>? Let's just make <strong>b = a</strong>! It's sneaky, but <strong>x</strong> can technically just be <strong>a</strong>. Now, an <strong>integral</strong> from <strong>a</strong> to <strong>a</strong> is just clearly <strong>0</strong>, because there is no area. Thus, <strong>C = -F(a)</strong>. Now, we've essentially discovered the second part of the fundamental theorem of calculus.</p>\\\\[ \\\\begin{array}{l} F(x) + C = \\\\int_{a}^{x} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\\\\\ C = -F(a) \\\\end{array} \\\\]<p>Therefore:</p>\\\\[ F(x) - F(a) = \\\\int_{a}^{x} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\]<p>We are pretty much done here, but the proof is shown for an interval between defined point <strong>A</strong> to defined point <strong>B</strong>, so we can just let <strong>x = a</strong>. This also allows us to not have to use the dummy variable <strong>t</strong> anymore and just make that <strong>x</strong>.</p>\\\\[ \\\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\\\, dx = F(b) - F(a) \\\\]<p>Simple, yet impactful. Basically, it doesn't matter at all what happens between <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong>, the value for the <strong>integral</strong> on an interval is just <strong>F(b) - F(a)</strong>.</p>\"]}}")}}]);
