It is one of the most important topics in Mathematics and is the gateway for numerous other advanced concepts. While math revolves around Trigonometry, Trigonometry revolves around right triangles. A major reason for this is that only right triangles satisfy the Pythagorean Theorem, which states <strong>a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup></strong>, where sides <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> are the legs, while side <strong>c</strong> is the hypotenuse. One of the key aspects of right triangles is their strict vertical and horizontal side due to the 90\xb0 angle. This also means side <strong>c</strong> is essentially the slope (<strong>rise / run</strong>) of the triangle. Let\'s take a look at this right triangle:</p><img src=\'/imgs/Trigonometry/1_1.png\' alt=\'A right triangle with angles of \u03b1 and \u03b2. Opposite angle \u03b1 is side a.

There are a total of 6 ratios, each a trigonometric function. These operations are designated as functions because they completely rely on the angle between both sides.<br><br>Let\'s focus on angle <strong>\u03b1</strong>. Starting with the sine function, we know <strong>sin = opposite / hypotenuse</strong>. Applying that to angle <strong>\u03b1</strong>, we find that <strong>sin(\u03b1) = a / c</strong>, because side <strong>a</strong> is opposite to angle <strong>\u03b1</strong>, and side <strong>c</strong> is the hypotenuse of the triangle. Sine works the exact same way with any other angle. For example, <strong>sin(\u03b2) = b / c</strong>, as side <strong>b</strong> is opposite to angle <strong>\u03b2</strong>, and side <strong>c</strong> is again the hypotenuse of the triangle. Now that we know all about sine, let\'s look at the other core trigonometric functions:<br><br><strong>\u03b8 for any given angle:<br>Sine -> sin(\u03b8) = opposite / hypotenuse<br>Cosine -> cos(\u03b8) = adjacent / hypotenuse<br>Tangent -> tan(\u03b8) = opposite / adjacent</strong><br><br><p>Swapping the numerator and denominator of these core functions gives us their reciprocals:</p><br><br><strong>Cosecant -> csc(\u03b8) = hypotenuse / opposite = 1 / sin(\u03b8)<br>Secant -> sec(\u03b8) = adjacent / hypotenuse = 1 / cos(\u03b8)<br>Cotangent -> cot(\u03b8) = adjacent / opposite = 1 / tan(\u03b8)</strong><br><br><p>These 6 functions are all extremely important, with relationships to be further elucidated on as we go through trigonometry.
