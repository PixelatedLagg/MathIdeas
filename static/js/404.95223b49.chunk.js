It is one of the most important topics in Mathematics and is the gateway for numerous other advanced concepts. While math revolves around Trigonometry, Trigonometry revolves around right triangles. A major reason for this is that only right triangles satisfy the Pythagorean Theorem, which states <strong>a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup></strong>, where sides <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> are the legs, while side <strong>c</strong> is the hypotenuse. One of the key aspects of right triangles is their strict vertical and horizontal side due to the <strong>90\xb0</strong> angle. This also means side <strong>c</strong> is essentially the slope (<strong>rise / run</strong>) of the triangle.
