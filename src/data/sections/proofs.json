This theorem is used to find the length of any diagonal line which gives us a formula for how to calculate the distance between two points in space. But how was it proven?</p><p>Let's throw away any knowledge of the Pythagorean Theorem and simply try to answer this question: What is the length of this line on the coordinate plane?</p><img src='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836806873906806795/1148345307499868250/image.png'><p>Looking at the image, we can see that <strong>A = (-6, -3)</strong>, and <strong>B = (7, 6)</strong>. We can easily calculate distance when the points are on the same dimension, but how do we calculate distance when two dimensions are involved? Looking at <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>, we can see they are 13 units away horizontally and 12 units away vertically. Let's represent this as a triangle.</p>",

What similarity tells us is that the ratios of the side lengths must be equivalent. This is because while the triangles can have different sizes overall, their interior angles dictate the side length proportions. Therefore, when two angles are shown to be equal, the third must also be equal, creating these proportions. For example, in the previous model: <strong>a / b = e / d</strong>. Right triangles are the only triangles where you can have this and its two components similar, due to the creation of two equal degree angles when bisecting the hypotenuse. You can mess around with these ratios and find many relationships, so let's try to expand and discover something we didn’t expect.</p>",

These ratios are particularly interesting because they contain <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> side lengths of the main triangle twice in their respective equations.

Since <strong>c</strong> is in both of these equations, let's add them together to simplify things: <strong>a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = ce + cf</strong>. It is clear that we can factor out <strong>c</strong>: <strong>a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c(e + f)</strong>. Looking at the diagram: <strong>e + f = c</strong>, meaning we can substitute <strong>e + f</strong> out for <strong>c</strong> and get <strong>a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup></strong>. This relationship is not obvious at all, but can beautifully be derived from very simple similarity relationships. Some good news here is that since <strong>c</strong> is isolated, we can solve for the diagonal side length of a triangle given only vertical and horizontal lengths, being <strong>c = sqrt(a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup>)</strong>.
