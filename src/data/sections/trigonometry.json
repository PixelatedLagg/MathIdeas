It is one of the most important topics in Mathematics and is the gateway for numerous other advanced concepts. While math revolves around Trigonometry, Trigonometry revolves around right triangles. A major reason for this is that only right triangles satisfy the Pythagorean Theorem, which states <strong>a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup></strong>, where sides <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> are the legs, while side <strong>c</strong> is the hypotenuse. One of the key aspects of right triangles is their strict vertical and horizontal side due to the 90° angle. This also means side <strong>c</strong> is essentially the slope (<strong>rise / run</strong>) of the triangle. Let's take a look at this right triangle:</p><img src='/imgs/Trigonometry/1_1.png' alt='A right triangle with angles of α and β. Opposite angle α is side a. Opposite angle β is side b. The hypotenuse is side c.'>",

                "text" : "<p>With just this diagram, we can identify many different ratios between the sides. There are a total of 6 ratios, each a trigonometric function. These operations are designated as functions because they completely rely on the angle between both sides.<br><br>Let's focus on angle <strong>α</strong>. Starting with the sine function, we know <strong>sin = opposite / hypotenuse</strong>. Applying that to angle <strong>α</strong>, we find that <strong>sin(α) = a / c</strong>, because side <strong>a</strong> is opposite to angle <strong>α</strong>, and side <strong>c</strong> is the hypotenuse of the triangle. Sine works the exact same way with any other angle. For example, <strong>sin(β) = b / c</strong>, as side <strong>b</strong> is opposite to angle <strong>β</strong>, and side <strong>c</strong> is again the hypotenuse of the triangle. Now that we know all about sine, let's look at the other core trigonometric functions:<br><br><strong>θ for any given angle:<br>Sine -> sin(θ) = opposite / hypotenuse<br>Cosine -> cos(θ) = adjacent / hypotenuse<br>Tangent -> tan(θ) = opposite / adjacent</strong><br><br><p>Swapping the numerator and denominator of these core functions gives us their reciprocals:</p><br><br><strong>Cosecant -> csc(θ) = hypotenuse / opposite = 1 / sin(θ)<br>Secant -> sec(θ) = adjacent / hypotenuse = 1 / cos(θ)<br>Cotangent -> cot(θ) = adjacent / opposite = 1 / tan(θ)</strong><br><br><p>These 6 functions are all extremely important, with relationships to be further elucidated on as we go through trigonometry. For now though, it's important to simply understand where these functions come from and how they're used in relation to right triangles.</p>",

Our goal is to find side length <strong>c</strong>, but we aren't given both sides <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong>. So what is side <strong>c</strong>? Which trigonometric function will encompass both side length<strong>11</strong> and side <strong>c</strong> to return the angle? Looking at the <strong>42°</strong> angle, we can see the side with length <strong>11</strong> is adjacent to it, and side <strong>c</strong> is the hypotenuse of the triangle.
