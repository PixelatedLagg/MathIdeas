It is one of the most important topics in Mathematics and is the gateway for numerous other advanced concepts. While math revolves around Trigonometry, Trigonometry revolves around right triangles. A major reason for this is that only right triangles satisfy the Pythagorean Theorem, which states <strong>a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup></strong>, where sides <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> are the legs, while side <strong>c</strong> is the hypotenuse. One of the key aspects of right triangles is their strict vertical and horizontal side due to the 90° angle. This also means side <strong>c</strong> is essentially the slope (<strong>rise / run</strong>) of the triangle. Let's take a look at this right triangle:</p><img src='/imgs/Trigonometry/1_1.png' alt='A right triangle with angles of α and β. Opposite angle α is side a. Opposite angle β is side b. The hypotenuse is side c.'>",

These operations are designated as functions because they completely rely on the angle between both sides.<br><br>Let's focus on angle <strong>α</strong>. Starting with the sine function, we know <strong>sin = opposite / hypotenuse</strong>. Applying that to angle <strong>α</strong>, we find that <strong>sin(α) = a / c</strong>, because side <strong>a</strong> is opposite to angle <strong>α</strong>, and side <strong>c</strong> is the hypotenuse of the triangle. Sine works the exact same way with any other angle. For example, <strong>sin(β) = b / c</strong>, as side <strong>b</strong> is opposite to angle <strong>β</strong>, and side <strong>c</strong> is again the hypotenuse of the triangle. Now that we know all about sine, let's look at the other core trigonometric functions:<br><br><strong>θ for any given angle:<br>Sine -> sin(θ) = opposite / hypotenuse<br>Cosine -> cos(θ) = adjacent / hypotenuse<br>Tangent -> tan(θ) = opposite / adjacent</strong><br><br><p>Swapping the numerator and denominator of these core functions gives us their reciprocals:</p><br><br><strong>Cosecant -> csc(θ) = hypotenuse / opposite = 1 / sin(θ)<br>Secant -> sec(θ) = adjacent / hypotenuse = 1 / cos(θ)<br>Cotangent -> cot(θ) = adjacent / opposite = 1 / tan(θ)</strong><br><br><p>These 6 functions are all extremely important, with relationships to be further elucidated on as we go through trigonometry.

Angles, which measure circular rotation, max out at <strong>360 degrees</strong>—a number chosen for its wide range of divisors, simplifying angle division. However, for mathematical rigor, we use radians, derived from the unit circle's circumference (<strong>2π</strong> for a circle of radius <strong>1</strong>). To convert between degrees and radians, use the ratios <strong>180/π</strong> or <strong>π/180</strong>.</p><p>Angles extend from the positive x-axis, measured counterclockwise. For instance, an angle of <strong>500 degrees</strong> surpasses a full circle and is reduced to <strong>140 degrees</strong> by subtracting <strong>360 degrees</strong>. Negative angles rotate clockwise, with <strong>-1 degree</strong> equating to <strong>359 degrees</strong>. The unit circle is split into four quadrants at every <strong>π/4 radians (90 degrees)</strong>, with the x and y axes marking their boundaries.</p><p>Understanding the unit circle's role in trigonometry is crucial when examining right triangles. Special triangles, such as the <strong>45-45-90</strong> and <strong>30-60-90</strong>, provide exact angles and side ratios. By fitting these triangles within the unit circle (with a hypotenuse of <strong>1</strong>), we can pinpoint coordinates for specific angles, which correspond to their sine and cosine values.

As sine increases, cosine decreases, and each function has two angles yielding the same value.

We can also see that <strong>cos(2π - x) = cos(x)</strong>, and <strong>sin(2π - x) = -sin(x)</strong>. We know <strong>tan(x)</strong> is the slope, so when cos or sin is negative, it will be negative. Therefore, <strong>tan(x + π) = tan(x)</strong>, <strong>tan(x - π) = -tan(x)</strong>, and <strong>tan(-x) = -tan(x)</strong>.

Well <strong>cos = adj / hyp</strong>, so <strong>sin(x + π/2) = cos(x)</strong>. <strong>cos(x + π/2) = -sin(x)</strong>.
