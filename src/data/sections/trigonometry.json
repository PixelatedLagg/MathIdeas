It is one of the most important topics in Mathematics and is the gateway for numerous other advanced concepts. While math revolves around Trigonometry, Trigonometry revolves around right triangles. A major reason for this is that only right triangles satisfy the Pythagorean Theorem, which states <strong>a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup></strong>, where sides <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> are the legs, while side <strong>c</strong> is the hypotenuse. One of the key aspects of right triangles is their strict vertical and horizontal side due to the 90° angle. This also means side <strong>c</strong> is essentially the slope (<strong>rise / run</strong>) of the triangle. Let's take a look at this right triangle:</p><img src='/imgs/Trigonometry/1_1.png' alt='A right triangle with angles of α and β. Opposite angle α is side a. Opposite angle β is side b.

These operations are designated as functions because they completely rely on the angle between both sides.<br><br>Let's focus on angle <strong>α</strong>. Starting with the sine function, we know <strong>sin = opposite / hypotenuse</strong>. Applying that to angle <strong>α</strong>, we find that <strong>sin(α) = a / c</strong>, because side <strong>a</strong> is opposite to angle <strong>α</strong>, and side <strong>c</strong> is the hypotenuse of the triangle. Sine works the exact same way with any other angle. For example, <strong>sin(β) = b / c</strong>, as side <strong>b</strong> is opposite to angle <strong>β</strong>, and side <strong>c</strong> is again the hypotenuse of the triangle. Now that we know all about sine, let's look at the other core trigonometric functions:<br><br><strong>θ for any given angle:<br>Sine -> sin(θ) = opposite / hypotenuse<br>Cosine -> cos(θ) = adjacent / hypotenuse<br>Tangent -> tan(θ) = opposite / adjacent</strong><br><br><p>Swapping the numerator and denominator of these core functions gives us their reciprocals:</p><br><br><strong>Cosecant -> csc(θ) = hypotenuse / opposite = 1 / sin(θ)<br>Secant -> sec(θ) = adjacent / hypotenuse = 1 / cos(θ)<br>Cotangent -> cot(θ) = adjacent / opposite = 1 / tan(θ)</strong><br><br><p>These 6 functions are all extremely important, with relationships to be further elucidated on as we go through trigonometry.

Angles, which measure circular rotation, max out at <strong>360 degrees</strong>—a number chosen for its wide range of divisors, simplifying angle division. However, for mathematical rigor, we use radians, derived from the unit circle's circumference (<strong>2π</strong> for a circle of radius <strong>1</strong>). To convert between degrees and radians, use the ratios <strong>180/π</strong> or <strong>π/180</strong>.</p><p>Angles extend from the positive x-axis, measured counterclockwise. For instance, an angle of <strong>500 degrees</strong> surpasses a full circle and is reduced to <strong>140 degrees</strong> by subtracting <strong>360 degrees</strong>. Negative angles rotate clockwise, with <strong>-1 degree</strong> equating to <strong>359 degrees</strong>.

Special triangles, such as the <strong>45-45-90</strong> and <strong>30-60-90</strong>, provide exact angles and side ratios. By fitting these triangles within the unit circle (with a hypotenuse of <strong>1</strong>), we can pinpoint coordinates for specific angles, which correspond to their sine and cosine values.

This is very important. Remember that when we graph cosine and sine graphs, they intersect <strong>x = 0</strong> every <strong>π</strong> period. However, in <strong>csc</strong> and <strong>sec</strong>, they cannot divide by 0. Let's call these points Asymptotes.</p><p>Here for the <strong>csc</strong> graph, these are all the points we know that it is undefined in. What happens when we approach those points? They must either approach infinity or negative infinity, as when the denominator gets smaller, it returns a larger and larger value. When the <strong>sin</strong> graph is in the positive half of the coordinate plane, it must blow up to infinity, and when the <strong>sin</strong> graph is negative, it will blow up to negative infinity. Let's quickly graph a sine graph to visualize this.</p><p>As we see, some parts stay between <strong>0 - 1</strong> and others go from <strong>0 to -1</strong>. Our <strong>csc</strong> graph will touch the <strong>sin</strong> graph when it peaks at <strong>1</strong> or <strong>-1</strong>, as <strong>1/1 = 1</strong>, but will diverge from there. In the negative parts, to <strong>-∞</strong>. With this information, we can create our graph.</p><p>The Graph in gray is your <strong>csc</strong> graph off of the <strong>cos</strong> graph, and your graph is now done. The <strong>sec</strong> graph is done the exact same way.</p><p>This process helps you graph any <strong>sec</strong> or <strong>csc</strong> graph, as you simply graph the <strong>sin</strong> or <strong>cos</strong> graph and then apply the asymptote idea.</p>"
